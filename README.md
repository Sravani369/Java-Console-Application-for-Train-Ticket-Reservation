# Train Ticket Reservation System

## Project Overview
The **Train Ticket Reservation System** is a Java-based console application that allows users to book, view, and cancel train tickets. The project follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation and abstraction to ensure modularity and maintainability.

## Features
- **Book Ticket**: Users can enter passenger details and book a train ticket.
- **View Reservations**: Displays all booked tickets.
- **Cancel Ticket**: Users can cancel a booked ticket by selecting its number.
- **Error Handling**: Input validation ensures a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core Java concepts and OOP principles)
- **ArrayList** (For managing ticket reservations efficiently)
- **Scanner Class** (For user input handling)

## How to Run the Application
1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) if not already installed.
2. Clone or download the project files.
3. Open the project in Eclipse, IntelliJ, or any Java IDE.
4. Compile and run `TrainTicketReservation.java`.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to book, view, or cancel tickets.

## Code Structure
- `TrainTicketReservation.java` - Main application logic, handles user input and ticket management.
- `Ticket.java` - Defines the `Ticket` class, encapsulating ticket details (Passenger Name, Train Number, Date).

## Enhancements and Future Scope
- **Data Persistence**: Store ticket reservations in a file or database.
- **User Authentication**: Implement user login for personalized ticket management.
- **Seat Selection**: Allow users to choose specific seats.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Upgrade the console-based system to a GUI application.
